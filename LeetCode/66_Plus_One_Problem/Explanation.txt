1. Start from the least significant digit (the last element of the vector) and add 1 to it.

2. Loop through the digits from right to left. If a digit becomes 10 (due to carry), set it to 0 and increment the next digit (to the left).

3. Continue this process until there are no more carry digits or you reach the most significant digit.

4. If the most significant digit still has a carry, insert a new 1 at the beginning of the vector.

5. Return the updated vector representing the incremented integer.
