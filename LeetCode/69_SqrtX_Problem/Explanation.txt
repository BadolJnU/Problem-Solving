1. If x is 0, return 0.
2. Initialize first to 1 and last to x.
3. While first is less than or equal to last, do the following:
	a. Compute mid as first + (last - first) / 2.
	b. If mid * mid equals x, return mid.
	c. If mid * mid is greater than x, update last to mid - 1.
	d. If mid * mid is less than x, update first to mid + 1.
4. Return last.
